# Horusec Example Vulnerabilities

This repository contains some examples of vulnerabilities for you test horusec analysis.

## What is Horusec?
Horusec is an open source tool that performs static code analysis to identify security flaws during the development process. Currently, the languages for analysis are: C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Golang, Terraform, Javascript, Typescript, Kubernetes, PHP, C, HTML, JSON, Dart, Elixir, Shell, Nginx. The tool has options to search for key leaks and security flaws in all files of your project, as well as in Git history. Horusec can be used by the developer through the CLI and by the DevSecOps team on CI /CD mats. See in our [DOCUMENTATION](https://horusec.io/docs/overview/) the complete list of tools and languages that we perform analysis
